You bear all such losses.

**3.2 Refund of Fees:** VIP Member services are online and virtual goods, provided on a prepaid basis. The membership fee corresponds to the price of the network goods you purchase, not as a prepayment, deposit, or savings card.

**3.3 Changes in Charging Standards and Methods:** The charging methods and standards for VIP Member services (including auto-renewal) are determined independently by 0XPassword based on operational costs, strategies, etc., and will be displayed on the related product service promotion and payment pages. If the payment method changes when you purchase or renew, the actual accepted method by 0XPassword shall prevail. Any adjustments to the service price shall be based on the current effective price publicly displayed on the 0XPassword platform. You agree that your continued operation (including but not limited to clicking to agree, continuing to purchase, completing the payment, or using VIP Member services) is deemed to acknowledge and agree to the changed charging method and standard.

**3.4 Auto-Renewal:** The auto-renewal service is provided to ensure that VIP Members who have purchased the VIP Member service do not miss renewal due to negligence or other reasons.
